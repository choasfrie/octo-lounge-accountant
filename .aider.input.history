+Thank you! Please make the following updates:
+
+Mark any current numbers as Temporary, as they will eventually come from the backend.
+Add a new tab specifically for displaying accounts in T-account form:
+Create two temporary T-account examples to demonstrate the layout.
+Each T-account should display the account name and include debit (+) and credit (-) sides.
+Add a small book icon (using Font Awesome) next to each account entry. When clicked, this icon should trigger an interaction (e.g., opening a details view or showing additional options).
+Please ensure these changes match the styling in index.html.
